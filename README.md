# Future-Skill-Magic-Number
Trial
This is a trial test which is meant to give an opportunity to try out the interface before the actual test is started.

The task is to implement a method which returns a "magical number" determined by the API. Simply get the number from the API and return it to solve the test.

Each level will ask for the magic number twice, and the number returned from the API will be changed in between. You get five points for returning a correct number, and ten points for solving a level, there are three levels for a total of 30 points.

Every run operation will try to solve all three levels at once, and you can use the canvas controlls to change which level is displayed.

This is a very simple task but please take the opportunity to try out the interface, determine how to do printouts to the console in the bottom right corner etc.

There is a help function which you access via the button with a question mark in the top right corner.
